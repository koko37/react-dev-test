Pastors Line - React developer test

This test is intended to check you are using the best practices and you know how to use libraries we are using. This is a small task, but please think about it as a part of something bigger.

Please create a public repository on your Github or Bitbucket account and push the code there. Use branch /feature/react-dev-test and merge it to master via Pull Request.

Task description
The main screen should have two buttons (Button A and Button B described below) centered vertically and horizontally with a margin between.

Clicking on Button A should open a Modal A. Clicking on Button B should open a Modal B.

Both modals should have three buttons:
Modal Button A - labeled ‘All Contacts’, switching to Modal A
Modal Button B - labeled ‘US Contacts’, switching to Modal B
Modal Button C - labeled ‘Close’, closing modals
and a checkbox in a footer, LHS:
Checkbox A - labeled ‘Only even’, when checked, only contacts with even ID (ex. 2, 4, 6...) should be displayed.

In Modal A should be displayed (from API) contacts from all countries.
In Modal B should be displayed (from API) contacts only from US.

Clicking on the contact items in modals should open a next modal (Modal C) with few contact details, no matter what.

Opening Modals A and B should change the URL of the page.
Opening Modal C should NOT change the URL.

Button A and Modal Button A should have a color: #46139f
Button B and Modal Button B should have a color: #ff7f50
Button C should have a white background and border #46139f (same as the background of Button A)

Modals A and B should have a search box to filter contacts (use API param). Contacts should be filtered while typing in a search input (with a small delay) and immediately on hitting the Enter key.

Lists of contacts should display only the first page (API param, page=1) after scrolling to bottom of modal load next page (infinity scroll).
